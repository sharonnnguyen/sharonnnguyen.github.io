        <p>
           Hey! My name is Sharon Nguyen and I'm a first year fashion design student at Massey University. I have been interested in art all my life and here are some previous work of mine.

                    <p>Art Painting was one of my favorite subjects while I was in college. The course helped me develop creative thinking and made me realize how passionate I am about doing art.

                       This was my first art painting portfolio I created in year 11. The portfolio is based on my life so I wanted to incorporate aspects from both of my culture background Vietnam and New Zealand within it.

                       For my second portfolio, I wanted to explore more on a personal interest of mine which is dressmaking. As you can see through the portfolio, the process of producing a dress is shown through many of steps like picking fabrics, sewing, designing, modeled and off to the runway.

                        For my final college Art Painting submission, I've decided to create this 3 panelboard portfolio going back in time to discover deeper into my culture roots. Through these boards, I explored Vietnamese fairy tales from thousands of years back, to the wars we had to fight and learn more about the celebrations we enjoy as a country. This was very special to me as I felt like I have understood more about my homeland and realized how far we have come.

                      For my Graphic Design portfolio, I had chosen to design for a clothing brand called "Untouchable". Through this, I was able to produce brand logos, swing tags, posters and websites. Not only that, but I was able learn more about graphic design, how to hold a photoshoot, design on photoshop and be creative as I can be.

               Fashion has always been a major interest of mine and this year, I had the opportunity to design an outcome for my 212.157 Dress class. This task was to design a wearable structure based on your partner's mihimihi. The making of this garment was a long journey with lots of effort and time put into it but in the end it was all worth it and turned out to be a very valuable experience for me.

                        My tea cup dress was inspired through a conversation I had with my partner Millie as she told me her favorite color is silver and that the reason behind this is because she’s always been fascinated with the silverware she has seen at her nonna’s house while growing up. Her family have been collecting silverware for the last 4 generations with items like silver tea cups, tea pots to spoons, jugs and many more. I could feel the connection she had towards these antique silverware and felt really inspired to create an outcome based on this connection of hers.
